It is a bot for discord that gets data from the osu api and shoves them somewhere. Basically am trying to learn :)

Dependencies:
discord.js
node-osu

If you want to try this out yourself for some reason, rename "tokensTemplate.json" to "tokens.json" and input your tokens there. Then you should do "node bot.js" and everything SHOULD work

Btw this readme is very much wip so pls ignore most of this stuff
