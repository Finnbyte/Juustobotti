It is a bot for discord that gets data from the osu api and shoves them somewhere. Basically am trying to learn :)

Dependencies:
discord.js
node-osu
dotenv
mysql

You'll need your own MySQL database. For that you can use WAMP on windows or something idk

If you want to try this out yourself for some reason, create your own .env file with this "template":

BOTTOKEN=

OSUTOKEN=

and then do `npm i` and `node bot.js`

Btw this readme is very much wip so pls ignore most of this stuff

TODO: 

- [x] Get the bot working with another database mongo bad
- [ ] I guess make the linking of a profile work correctly
