# Juustobotti
It is a bot for discord that gets data from the osu api and shoves them somewhere. Basically am trying to learn :)

Dependencies:
discord.js
node-osu
dotenv
mongodb


If you want to try this out yourself for some reason, create your own .env file with this "template":

BOTTOKEN=

OSUTOKEN=

DBURL="mongodb://localhost:27017"

PREFIX="ju!"

and then do node bot.js

Btw this readme is very much wip so pls ignore most of this stuff
