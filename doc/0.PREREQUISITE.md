# Prep for getting juusto running at all

NOTE: I am making a system where you don't need to setup all of these. Makes life easier for future devs. Make sure to read them and install for now!

NOTE for Linux users: The commands shown below assume you're running under root. 

NOTE for Windows users: Just use WSL lol makes your life easier I hope.

## Node.js
My environment uses Node.js version 16.19.0. Might work with newer node too but havent done any testing.
### For Windows
If unsure just download the 64 bit one, most likely works on your machine.
[64 bit direct download link](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.20.1/node-v16.20.1-x64.msi)
[32 bit direct download link](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v16.20.1/node-v16.20.1-x86.msi)

### For (gnu/)Linux
Arch: 
```sh
pacman -Syu nodejs-lts-gallium
```

Ubuntu/Debian:
```sh
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | bash - &&\
apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Others: 
* [Via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
* [Manually from binary](https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation)
* [Building from source](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/BUILDING.md#building-nodejs-on-supported-platforms)


## MariaDB
This is kinda important to setup. I use MariaDB for osu! related stuff. I am using an ancient version of MariaDB since they got pretty good compatibility.

### Windows
Just go [here](https://mariadb.org/download/?t=mariadb) and install it. I don't know how to set it up on Windows but probably just boot it up and ready to go.

### Gnu/Linux
Arch:
```sh
pacman -S mariadb
systemctl enable mysqld.service
systemctl start mysqld.service
mysql_secure_installation
```
Debian/Ubuntu:
```sh
apt-get install mariadb-server
mysql_secure_installation
```
Others: Check the [Downloads page](https://mariadb.org/download/)


## MongoDB
I use MongoDB for the currency related commands and storing the server-specific prefix.

I use a selfhosted instance of MongoDB Community Server but I think you can also use one of their servers. Keep in mind that selfhosted is (usually) much more secure :)

You can find installation instructions [Here on their website](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/). Im too lazy to write them here sorry :(
